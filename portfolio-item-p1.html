              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>
                The performance of the user 1:<br />
                Even though the user 1 don’t have an experience in using the AMC
                website to purchase tickets, she did know how to complete her
                task. The user 1 tended to spend more time reviewing the page
                contexts before she started to do any action such as clicking
                the button. She didn’t face any problem while she was performing
                the task.
              </p>
              <p>
                The performance of the user 2:<br />
                When the user 2 clicked See A Movie on the menu bar, he expected
                the button will prompt him to the new page, but he ended up
                opening the submenu. He didn’t face any problem while he was
                performing the task.
